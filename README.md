## üõ†Ô∏è Key Projects  

### **[LLaMaCVE](https://github.com/cyse7125-su24-team10)**  
An **AI-powered CVE (Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities) Insights Platform** combining LLMs with modern DevOps practices to help users **secure devices**, **detect vulnerabilities early**, and **adapt to emerging cyber threats**. This platform offers high reliability and a user-friendly interface, powered by **real-time CVE processing**, **LLMs**, and **scalable infrastructure**.

- **RAG Chatbot**: Developed a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot** using **Llama-3.1-8b**, **LangChain**, and **Python** to process **250K CVE JSON records**. Integrated the **Pinecone vector database** to store embeddings of CVE data, enabling fast, real-time queries and access to the latest CVE insights.

- **Data Processing & Storage**: Built **3 microservices** in **Go** for **CVE data normalization** and **Kafka publishing**. Ensured seamless data management with **Flyway migrations** for **PostgreSQL**, maintaining schema integrity and automating updates.

- **Kubernetes Cluster**: Deployed a **highly available Kubernetes cluster** on **AWS** with **multi-AZ deployment**. Integrated **Istio** for secure service-to-service communication, **Kafka** for real-time messaging, and **KMS** for encryption, ensuring high availability and scalability for **CVE processing** and the RAG model. Managed infrastructure with **Helm charts** and auto-scaling for **CVE processing applications**, ensuring optimal performance under varying workloads.

- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated deployment pipelines using **Jenkins DSL** and **Terraform** for seamless deployment of the model on **Amazon EKS**. Real-time data processing is handled via **Kafka streaming**, ensuring timely and accurate insights.

- **Service Mesh & Security**: Deployed an **Istio service mesh** with **Ingress**, **VirtualService**, and **mTLS** for secure, reliable communication between microservices. Integrated **Kiali** and **Jaeger** for traffic management, tracing, and visualization, reducing troubleshooting time by **30%** and improving operational efficiency.

- **Centralized Monitoring**: Implemented centralized monitoring with the **EFK stack** and **Prometheus/Grafana** for logging, metrics collection, and visualization. Achieved **99.9% alert accuracy**, reducing **mean time to detection (MTTD)** by **40%**.

- **Kubernetes Operator**: Designed a custom CRD-based **Kubebuilder operator** to monitor and process hourly CVE releases, automatically fetching new CVE records and integrating them with **Kafka** and **Pinecone** for indexing and real-time processing.

- **Automated Deployments**: Automated **AWS AMI** image building using **HashiCorp Packer** with pre-configured **Jenkins** and **NGINX**. Streamlined deployments using **Terraform** and **GitHub webhooks** for continuous integration. Built **CI/CD pipelines** to build and push Docker images, enabling seamless containerized application deployment with zero downtime during updates.

- **Security Posture Enhancement**: Improved security by automating **SSL/TLS certificate management** with **cert-manager** and **secret management** using **SOPS**, ensuring zero downtime during key rotations and improving security by **35%**.

- **LLM Deployment**: The **Llama-3.1-8b** model is deployed using the **Ollama service** on an **AWS GPU instance g5.xlarge**, ensuring efficient and scalable real-time CVE data processing and inference.
